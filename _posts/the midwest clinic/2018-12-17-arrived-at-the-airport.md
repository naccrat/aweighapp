We arrived at the airport bright and early. A little too early for me but with a bunch of Jr high kids you want to make sure there is time to correct issues that go wrong. It appeared that everyone arrived and got checked in without any issues. We got through security pretty easy and then had time to eat some breakfast. We tried out the Cafe Rio breakfast burrito which was much better than the other breakfast options. As a frequent airport traveler I'm so glad they have normal food options in the airports.Â
