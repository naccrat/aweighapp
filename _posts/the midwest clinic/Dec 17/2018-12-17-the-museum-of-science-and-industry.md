We had a couple of hours to spend at the museum of science and industry, which was very cool and you penalty needed a full day to experience everything. We were able to see the German U-505 that was captured during WWII. Thank you to the security guard that gave us so much info about the boat, that made the trip. 

We also went in the mirror maze which was pretty cool and then got indoctrinated about global warming and many other cool things.
