The time for the performance has come. I think nerves were a little high but after they started the first song, they were in the groove. 

They sounded so good it even was making me a little teary eyed. The guest player was amazing, the singer was awesome, the solos were spot on (Kimball had two different ones) and the performance was a standing ovation. 

Every member of the band should be proud of what they did and what they accomplished.
