To end the evening we went to the Willis building to visit the sky deck. I love going to see the views of the city. The great thing about this is the sky deck which is a glass balcony. It is a great experience and makes you a little nervous. It was fun to see everyone's reaction to it as they stepped out. Thanks to the crew that let us over take the place.
