Myself and some of the other adults went to get all the bags off the carousel while the students got lunch. It was quite the production and I'm sure in was a pain for dinner to get by as the bags were all stacked Sunday the wall by the carousel. I think we got them all and no instruments were damaged. At least not that we know of yet.

While I was helping Melissa stopped to get us lunch. She got a Chicago dog and I got a brawt. Neither we great but the Chicago dog was much better.

After all the kids and groups retuned we found our way to the bus and headed for the hotel.
