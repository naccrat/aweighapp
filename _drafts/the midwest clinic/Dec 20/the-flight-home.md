We arrived at the airport with time to get something to get checked in, eat, and get on the plane. The TSA Pre line was a joke at this airport. The group of 30 kids got through the regular security line faster that a few of us got through the Pre line. There seemed to be a lot of construction so hopefully that is all that it was. If not, that airport needs some serious help.

The Southwest crew was kind enough to let our group get on the plane first and fill in the back of the plane. There were some people upset by that until we told them we are going to the back, then they didn't have an issue. I'm not sure it was great for us because three Jr. High kids sitting behind us made for a less than ideal flight. There were a couple of times I had to tell them to stop banging against my chair.

Overall, the flight was doable but that was the second Southwest flight, the first going to Chicago, that the wifi wasn't working so we couldn't do that in-flight entertainment.
