<p>They sounded so good it even was making me a little teary eyed. The guest player was amazing, the singer was awesome, the solos were spot on (Kimball had two different ones) and the performance was a standing ovation.</p>

<p>Every member of the band should be proud of what they did and what they accomplished.</p>

It is a great experience and makes you a little nervous. It was fun to see everyone’s reaction to it as they stepped out. Thanks to the crew that let us over take the place.</p>

There was a lot of walking back and forth since there wasn’t anyone around that knew what we were to do. We got it all figured out and it turned out good.</p>

We were able to see the German U-505 that was captured during WWII. Thank you to the security guard that gave us so much info about the boat, that made the trip. </p>

At least not that we know of yet.</p>

        <p>We arrived at the airport bright and early. A little too early for me but with a bunch of Jr high kids you want to make sure there is time to correct issues that go wrong. It appeared that everyone arrived and got checked in without any issues. We got through security pretty easy and then had time to eat some breakfast. We tried out the Cafe Rio breakfast burrito which was much better than the other breakfast options. As a frequent airport traveler I’m so glad they have normal food options in the airports. </p>

They auditioned last year, got accepted, and started practicing through the summer and early mornings and late afternoons. It has been pretty intense but they all committed and now it is time for them to reap the rewards.</p>
