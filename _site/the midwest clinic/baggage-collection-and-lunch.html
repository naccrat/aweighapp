<p>Myself and some of the other adults went to get all the bags off the carousel while the students got lunch. It was quite the production and Iâ€™m sure in was a pain for dinner to get by as the bags were all stacked Sunday the wall by the carousel. I think we got them all and no instruments were damaged. At least not that we know of yet.</p>

<p>While I was helping Melissa stopped to get us lunch. She got a Chicago dog and I got a brawt. Neither we great but the Chicago dog was much better.</p>

<p>After all the kids and groups retuned we found our way to the bus and headed for the hotel.</p>
