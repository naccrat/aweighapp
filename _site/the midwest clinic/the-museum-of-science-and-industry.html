<p>We had a couple of hours to spend at the museum of science and industry, which was very cool and you penalty needed a full day to experience everything. We were able to see the German U-505 that was captured during WWII. Thank you to the security guard that gave us so much info about the boat, that made the trip. </p>

<p>We also went in the mirror maze which was pretty cool and then got indoctrinated about global warming and many other cool things. </p>
