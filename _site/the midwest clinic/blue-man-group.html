<p>To end the day we got to go see the Blue Man Group. On our way from McCormick Place arrangements were made to have have boxed dinners prepared for us. When the bus pulled up the boxes were ready for us. We had all picked out the sandwiches we wanted before the trip so it was easy to pass them out and start eating. We had about a 30 minute ride to the theatre so the timing was perfect.</p>

<p>The Blue Man Group was a loud, high energy show that was a lot of fun. All the kids really enjoyed themselves and there was a boy from our group that got to participate. I guess he had fallen asleep and when the performers came out into the audience they say him and scared him awake.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the theater didnâ€™t smell all that wonderful but it was still a fun show.</p>

<p>Then it was back on the bus for a loud ride back to the hotel.</p>
