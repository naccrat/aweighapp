<p>The time for the performance has come. I think nerves were a little high but after they started the first song, they were in the groove.</p>

<p>They sounded so good it even was making me a little teary eyed. The guest player was amazing, the singer was awesome, the solos were spot on (Kimball had two different ones) and the performance was a standing ovation.</p>

<p>Every member of the band should be proud of what they did and what they accomplished.</p>
