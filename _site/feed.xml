        <title>The Museum of Science and Industry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a couple of hours to spend at the museum of science and industry, which was very cool and you penalty needed a full day to experience everything. We were able to see the German U-505 that was captured during WWII. Thank you to the security guard that gave us so much info about the boat, that made the trip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also went in the mirror maze which was pretty cool and then got indoctrinated about global warming and many other cool things. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shedd Aquarium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We started the day at the shedd aquarium. We didn’t have a lot of time but we still saw a lot. We also got to see the dolphin show. We’ll, it was a water and land show so the was a sea lion and an owl. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had lunch there so we paid a lot of money to support the wildlife effort.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breakfast </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We started off the day with Breakfast. They have a kitchen with made or order omlets and many other items. They also had a few items in the buffet. When we went down some of the kids had already finished and were playing games.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dinner</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After exploring the pier we went over to Bubba Gump’s for Dinner. It wasn’t the best food but I realize it is hard to get a big group into a place so it was a good option. The kids seem to do fine and there was good conversation with the other adults.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free Time at Navy Pier </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had plenty of time to explore the area. Most of it was under construction so there were some shops but it mostly gave us a good view of the city scape at night. They have an indoor area where there are palm trees and topical plants. The smell instantly transported you from the cold weather to a nice tropical warm place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Arrived at the Hotel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the airport and all the kids got checked into their rooms. While they were settling in Melissa and I had to wait for our room to get ready since it wasn’t the official check in time. Unfortunately, it wasn’t ready in time for us before we had to leave as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole group got loaded on the bus to go down to the Nave Pier.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Baggage Collection and Lunch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Myself and some of the other adults went to get all the bags off the carousel while the students got lunch. It was quite the production and I’m sure in was a pain for dinner to get by as the bags were all stacked Sunday the wall by the carousel. I think we got them all and no instruments were damaged. At least not that we know of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/21C036C4-40E9-4ED1-BD0A-8DB56E47D390.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was helping Melissa stopped to get us lunch. She got a Chicago dog and I got a brawt. Neither we great but the Chicago dog was much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the kids and groups retuned we found our way to the bus and headed for the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Arrived at the airport</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the airport bright and early. A little too early for me but with a bunch of Jr high kids you want to make sure there is time to correct issues that go wrong. It appeared that everyone arrived and got checked in without any issues. We got through security pretty easy and then had time to eat some breakfast. We tried out the Cafe Rio breakfast burrito which was much better than the other breakfast options. As a frequent airport traveler I’m so glad they have normal food options in the airports. &lt;/p&gt;
