        <title>The Bean</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What trip to Chicago is complete without stopping at the”bean”? On the way to the airport we made about a 20 minute stop to get some pics by the bean.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blue Man Group</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To end the day we got to go see the Blue Man Group. It was a loud, high energy show. Unfortunately, the theater didn’t smell all that wonderful but it was still a fun show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was back on the bus for a loud ride back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Time Has Come</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The time for the performance has come. I think nerves were a little high but after they started the first song, they were in the groove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sounded so good it even was making me a little teary eyed. The guest player was amazing, the singer was awesome, the solos were spot on (Kimball had two different ones) and the performance was a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every member of the band should be proud of what they did and what they accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sound Check</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This might have been some members first sound check. It was a little long and painful but they got through it and went right into their warm up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Willis Tower Sky Deck</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To end the evening we went to the Willis building to visit the sky deck. I love going to see the views of the city. The great thing about this is the sky deck which is a glass balcony. It is a great experience and makes you a little nervous. It was fun to see everyone’s reaction to it as they stepped out. Thanks to the crew that let us over take the place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deep Dish Pizza</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t come to Chicago and not stop for some famous deep dish pizza. We had dinner at giordano’s pizza and it was wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rehearsal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Or next stop was to the McCormick place for the band to do a practice session before the big day. The guess performer came to warm up with them and it sounded amazing. There was a lot of walking back and forth since there wasn’t anyone around that knew what we were to do. We got it all figured out and it turned out good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Museum of Science and Industry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a couple of hours to spend at the museum of science and industry, which was very cool and you penalty needed a full day to experience everything. We were able to see the German U-505 that was captured during WWII. Thank you to the security guard that gave us so much info about the boat, that made the trip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also went in the mirror maze which was pretty cool and then got indoctrinated about global warming and many other cool things. &lt;/p&gt;
