        <title>The Museum of Science and Industry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a couple of hours to spend at the museum of science and industry, which was very cool and you penalty needed a full day to experience everything. We were able to see the German U-505 that was captured during WWII. Thank you to the security guard that gave us so much info about the boat, that made the trip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also went in the mirror maze which was pretty cool and then got indoctrinated about global warming and many other cool things. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shedd Aquarium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We started the day at the shedd aquarium. We didn’t have a lot of time but we still saw a lot. We also got to see the dolphin show. We’ll, it was a water and land show so the was a sea lion and an owl. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had lunch there so we paid a lot of money to support the wildlife effort.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breakfast </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We started off the day with Breakfast. They have a kitchen with made or order omlets and many other items. They also had a few items in the buffet. When we went down some of the kids had already finished and were playing games.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Baggage Collection and Lunch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Myself and some of the other adults went to get all the bags off the carousel while the students got lunch. It was quite the production and I’m sure in was a pain for dinner to get by as the bags were all stacked Sunday the wall by the carousel. I think we got them all and no instruments were damaged. At least not that we know of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was helping Melissa stopped to get us lunch. She got a Chicago dog and I got a brawt. Neither we great but the Chicago dog was much better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the kids and groups retuned we found our way to the bus and headed for the hotel. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Arrived at the airport</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the airport bright and early. A little too early for me but with a bunch of Jr high kids you want to make sure there is time to correct issues that go wrong. It appeared that everyone arrived and got checked in without any issues. We got through security pretty easy and then had time to eat some breakfast. We tried out the Cafe Rio breakfast burrito which was much better than the other breakfast options. As a frequent airport traveler I’m so glad they have normal food options in the airports. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bon Voyage Concert</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight was the Bon Voyage concert for the Farmington Jr. High Jazz Band. On Monday we will leave for the Midwest Clinic which is held at McCormick Place West in Chicago every year in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an amazing group of performers and the sound and quality of the pieces is amazing. This has been a long journey to get here. They auditioned last year, got accepted, and started practicing through the summer and early mornings and late afternoons. It has been pretty intense but they all committed and now it is time for them to reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
